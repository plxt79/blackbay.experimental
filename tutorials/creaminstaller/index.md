# Installation:
CreamInstaller is usually distributed as a zip or executable file. Here’s how you typically install it:

1. Download CreamInstaller from a trusted (but unofficial) source — forums or GitHub repos may have versions.
2. Extract the .zip or .rar file using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Run the CreamInstaller.exe file. It’s usually a portable program, so no actual installation is required.
Optional: You may need to run it as administrator for full file system access.
