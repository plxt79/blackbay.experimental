After downloading the setup file, run it as an administrator. A command prompt should pop up, press ENTER on your keyboard to complete the installation. There will be a floating SteamTools Icon, if it's not there, something not right

Unlocking games:
get lua & manifests files of the game you want to unlock, extract the zip (if you have one), select the lua and manifests (all of them) and drag them to the floating SteamTools icon. After that, right-click on the SteamTools icon and click "Restart Steam". Done!
